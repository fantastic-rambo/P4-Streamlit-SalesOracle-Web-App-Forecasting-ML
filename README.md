## Getting Started 🏁

Follow these instructions to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fantastic-rambo/P4-Streamlit-SalesOracle-Web-App-Forecasting-ML.git
   cd P4-Streamlit-SalesOracle-Web-App-Forecasting-ML
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App 🏃

```bash
streamlit run src/app/app.py
```

Access the app through your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## App Structure 🧱

- `src`: The main application directory.
- `app/`: Directory containing app components, utility functions and the main application script `app.py`.
- `model/`: Directory for storing pre-trained model and preprocessing tool.
- `notebook/`: Directory containing the data and the jupyter notebook for model training.

## Usage 📊

### Making Predictions 📈

1. Fill in the required fields such as the family of the store, store type, date, items on promotion, previous sales, and rolling mean.
2. Click the "Submit" button to receive a real-time sales prediction.

## Technologies Used 💻🔬

- Streamlit: Python web application framework.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library.
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting library.
- Joblib: Serialization and deserialization of models.

## Data Preprocessing 🧹🧮

The app preprocesses input data to ensure compatibility with the machine learning model. It scales and transforms the data as needed for accurate predictions using the preprocessor exported from the notebook.

## Model Training 🤖📓

The app employs a pre-trained XGBoost machine learning model (Details about training can be found in the notebook). The model was trained on historical sales data to provide accurate forecasts.
