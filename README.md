## Getting Started 🏁

Follow these instructions to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snyamson/P4-SalesSense-Interactive-Sales-Forecasting-Web-Application.git
   cd P4-SalesSense-Interactive-Sales-Forecasting-Web-Application
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App 🏃

```bash
streamlit run src/app/app.py
```

Access the app through your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## App Structure 🧱

- `src`: The main application directory.
- `app/`: Directory containing app components, utility functions and the main application script `app.py`.
- `model/`: Directory for storing pre-trained model and preprocessing tool.
- `notebook/`: Directory containing the data and the jupyter notebook for model training.

## Usage 📊

### Making Predictions 📈

1. Fill in the required fields such as the family of the store, store type, date, items on promotion, previous sales, and rolling mean.
2. Click the "Submit" button to receive a real-time sales prediction.

## Technologies Used 💻🔬

- Streamlit: Python web application framework.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library.
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting library.
- Joblib: Serialization and deserialization of models.
